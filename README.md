# Racoon City Sanctuary

## Project Description
We plan to design a database for a raccoon sanctuary. We plan to keep track of general employee information, business expenses, and the money we bring in with donations on certain days. 
We also will track what tasks need to be performed and what time they need to be performed.  We will keep track of general information about our enclosures, like how many raccoons live in the enclosure, the name of the enclosure, and the enclosure's ID. 
In addition, we plan to keep track of the raccoons in our sanctuary and provide general information about them, like their name, weight, length, and what enclosure they live inâ€”finally, general medical history and treatment of the raccoons.
